coding standards:
  whitespace:
    Indents - Equivalent to 2 spaces. Indent code another line when nesting inside of another block.

  line length:
    Try for 80 characters, no more than 100

  Brackets: Opening bracket always on the line below. This is for both definitions (functions and classes) and control structures (ifs, elses, switches, etc.)

  Naming: Please try for semantic names. Brief if possible, but always descriptive.
